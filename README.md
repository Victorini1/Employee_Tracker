  ## Description
  In this project I construct a simple employee database, that utilizes node and inquirer to gather and update informaiton on the various tabels. Using the node interface you are able to log and maintain employees and their roles/departments. This excercise was meant to demonstrate how node js can utilize MySQL from the CLI.
